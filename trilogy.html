    trilogy which means the sequunce of a thing that has three parts, a series of three,
    and in here it is the house for the Weeknd's first three albums of mixtapes.
    <br><br>
    and they are a trilogy beacuse you feel like you are watching a movie series in some sort
    how in the beggining the weeknd shesds the light in his early adulthood,
    it shows the nigatve effects of being abondend by a father figure at such a young age does, 
    so he went to music to reflect  upon it.
    <br><br>
    In house of ballons, it reflects this im fine from the outside but depressed from the inside,
    espiccily in the song house of ballons/glass table girls, the weeknd it tring to conmvinse himself that he is happy,
    saying "this is a happy house a happy place, ... oh this is fun" which indectaes that he wants to show the viewer he 
    is happy and evreything is fine but in reailty its not, it never have been.
